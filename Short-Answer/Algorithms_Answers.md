#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(1) - this is constant, will only run onnce


b) O(n log n)


c) O(n) - the function runs n times.

## Exercise II

binary search building 
f = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
start= f[3]

if it doesn't break, go halfway between the midpoint you just dropped form and the top of the building. Repeat process from this new midpoint.if it breaks, go halfway between the point you just dropped from and the bottom of the building. repeat this process form this new endpoint.this is like binary search, and has a time complexity of O(log n)
